You need Math::String, and thus the new Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat
versions of at least v1.33 as they can be found on CPAN or in Perl newer than
v5.7.1.

To install, untar, unzip and then run

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

If all tests pass, you might do:

	make install

to install this package.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - or
maybe this time not. >8+}=
